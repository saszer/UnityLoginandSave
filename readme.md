Built using DataBase Control Unity Asset Free

Switches between Login and Game Scene. 
We Can only Store one string using this plugin, 
we store it in json format to put multiple properties.

Keep Player_Properties and PlayerPropJson with same structure. 
json one is without monobehaviour and is used to just define the json.
Player_Properties can be attached to the game object. 


thanks brackies, thanks to asset developer.
